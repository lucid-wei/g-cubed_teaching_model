
# Introduction for this repo
This is a repository for storing the G-Cubed teaching version model implemented using python and documentation files for students.

Most of the documentations are also relevant for users of commercial versions of the model, but this site is not optimized for that and should be referenced with caution.

To read the documentation, please [go to this link](https://lucid-wei.github.io/g-cubed_teaching_model/site_src).
