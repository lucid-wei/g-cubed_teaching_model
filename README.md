# G-Cubed teaching model documentation

This git repository contains the documentation for the G-Cubed teaching model.

The documentation will be useful to anyone using the G-Cubed model.

If you are in a hurry, jump straight to [the teaching model documentation](https://lucid-wei.github.io/g-cubed_teaching_model).

Most of the documentation is also relevant for users of 
other model versions, but this site is not 
optimized for those model versions and so and should be 
referenced with caution especially in relation to the 
details of regions and sectors in the model.
