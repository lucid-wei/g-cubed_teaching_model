Database,DATAvR2018.csv,The database of values for the model variables in a range of years.
BaseYear,2018,The base year of the database that is loaded.
UserParameters,setparameters.csv,The user-specified parameter values
IOTables,IOTABLESvR2011.csv,The IO tables used for parameter calibration
Productivity,prodmat.csv,The productivity parameters
Population,modpop.csv,Population growth data
AutonomousEnergyEfficiencyImprovement,aeeinew.csv,Autonomous Energy Efficiency Improvement
CalibrationYear,2011,This should be related to the year used to create the database.
LinearisationYear,2011,Year around which the model is linearised.
CalibrationOfCarbonCoefficientsYear,2015,The year used to calibration carbon emissions coefficients.
StartYear,2018,Should be from the last year of available data but right now that is 2018
EndYear,2100,End year for projections.
FirstAvailableYear,1996,The first year for which we have actual data rather than projections.
LastAvailableYear,2021,The last year for which we have actual data rather than projections.
ProjectionBaseYear,2018,The base year for variable indices for the database used in doing projections.
StartProjectionYear,2019,The first year to create model projections for.
StableManifoldUsePolicyOptimisation,0,1 to use policy optimisation and 0 otherwise.
StableManifoldTolerance,1.00E-10,Convergence criterion when solving for the stable manifold.
StableManifoldMaximumIterations,1000,Maximum number of iterations allowed while solving for the stable manifold.
NeutralRealInterestRate,0.036,The neutral real interest rate as a decimal rather than percentage.
