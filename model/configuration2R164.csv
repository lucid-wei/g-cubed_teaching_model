Version,2R,The model version (number of regions followed by a letter indicating model type e.g. 2R)
Build,164,The model build - must start with a positive integer but can include other letters and digits (no spaces or punctuation though).
Debugging,1,Set to 1 if debugging and 0 otherwise. This affects model logging verbosity.
SymInputFile,ggg2r164.sym,The root SYM file containing the model definition. It may import other sym files to discover the full model definition.
Database,DATAvR2018.csv,The database of values for the model variables in a range of years.
BaseYear,2018,The base year for indices in the model's database.
UserParameters,setparameters.csv,The user-specified parameter values
IOTables,IOTABLESvR2011.csv,The IO tables used for parameter calibration
Productivity,prodmat.csv,The productivity parameters
Population,modpop.csv,Population growth data
AutonomousEnergyEfficiencyImprovement,aeeinew.csv,Autonomous Energy Efficiency Improvement
CalibrationYear,2011,The year to retrieve the data used for parameter calibration.
LinearisationYear,2011,Year determining the data used to linearise the model to generate baseline projections.
CalibrationOfCarbonCoefficientsYear,2015,The year used to calibration carbon emissions coefficients.
FirstProjectionYear,2018,The first year to create model projections for. There must be data in the database for this year.
LastProjectionYear,2100,The last year to generate projections for.
StableManifoldTolerance,1.00E-09,Convergence criterion when solving for the stable manifold.
StableManifoldMaximumIterations,1000,Maximum number of iterations allowed while solving for the stable manifold.
NeutralRealInterestRate,0.036,The neutral real interest rate as a decimal rather than percentage.
