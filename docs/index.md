# Introduction

This is documentation for users of the teaching 
version of the G-Cubed model implemented in Python.

The documentation covers:

1. [How to set up your computer to run the Python implementation of G-Cubed](environment_setup.md),
including how to install the G-Cubed Python package.

2. [Details of the version of the G-Cubed model used
for teaching](sym_model_definitions.md).

3. [The variables and equations in the teaching model](../model/sym/model_2R_164.html)

4. [How to set up simulation experiments](6simulations.md).

5. [The Python API](gcubed/index.html).

6. [The SYM model definition language](https://pjwilcoxen.github.io/sym/).

## A roadmap for learning

If you are first time user of the the G-Cubed python implementation, 
start by ensuring you have [correctly set up the Python environment](environment_setup.md).

Next, learn about the teaching model itself and how it is defined using [the SYM model
definition language](https://pjwilcoxen.github.io/sym/).

With your understanding of SYM the model definition language, [the documentation
for the teaching model](sym_model_definitions.md) including 
[the variable and equation details](../model/sym/model_2R_164.html) will
be straightforward to understand.

The documentation of the teaching model will also explain how to configure the model,
how to set up the information needed to calibrate the model parameters, and how to
use a database of past data on the model variables to do projections.

Finally, you will be ready to review the documentation explaining [how to run
your own simulation experiments](6simulations.md).

If you want to learn more about G-Cubed can be customised, 
[the API documentation](gcubed/index.html) will be relevant.
