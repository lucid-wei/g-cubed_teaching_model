# SYM model definitions

The entities and economic relationships between them are described using a set of equations.
Those equations define the model and they are expressed using 
[the SYM language](https://pjwilcoxen.github.io/sym/).

Such model definitions are referred to as SYM model definitions and they are stored in SYM files.

The SYM files for a given model are included in 
[the set of files needed to run a model](model_sym_files.md).

Software is need to process the SYM files for a model to generate the files used to run the model
in Python and to generate suitably usable HTML documentation of the model. Those files,
generated by the SYM processor are also  included in 
[the set of files needed to run a model](model_sym_files.md).

The SYM processor is an executable file. It is available in a version that can be
run on both

* [Windows](../sym/sym4win.exe) and
* [MacOS](../sym/sym4mac.exe).

To change a model's equations, you need to edit the SYM model definitions and then run them
through the SYM processor to update the various generated files.

These changes may also require alterations to the model database and other inputs, depending 
on the changes that have been made. If the changes are fundamental enough, them may require
modifications to the Python package for G-Cubed.

# SYM model documentation

The SYM processor can transform the model definitions into a single HTML page that documents
the model.

An example is the documentation of the teaching model can be found [here](../model/sym/model_2R_164.html).

The documentation sets out:

* definitions of various sets
* definitions of the model variables and their type and their units etc.
* the model parameters 
* the model equations. 

This documentation is key to understanding the model and to designing your own simulations. 
But before using the model documentation, it is helpful to understand a bit more about the 
SYM model definition language and what to expect in a model definition. That understanding
can be developed by reviewing [the SYM language](https://pjwilcoxen.github.io/sym/).

# Country and sector codes

COUNTRIES:  
U, USA, United States  
N, NUS, Not United States

SECTORS:  
01 Energy  
02 Non Energy

Y. Capital goods for firms  
Z. Household capital goods

# Sets

Because a same type of variable can be used to describe different objects, e.g. country U and country N both have their GDP values. 
Thus, variables must be defined over sets.

A set is a collection of distinct objects or elements, which are used to define variables, parameters and equations.

# Variables

## Variable Names

Variable names consist of the main name followed by relevant qualifier based on predefined **sets** enclosed within parentheses.

Examples:

Government debt in the USA is BOND(UU) where BOND is the main variable identifier and the qualifier contained in () is UU which is the country code for the USA.

The capital stock in sector 1 in the USA is defined as CAP(a01,UU) where CAP is the main variable idenitifier the first qualifier in () is the sector number and the second qualifier in the country code UU.

## Variable Types

end = normal endogenous  
ets = endogenous with lead  
cos = costate (or jumping variable - value is an integral of future variables)   
stl = state with lags  
sta = state (value is predetermined in period t)  
exo = exogenous (value is fixed)  

## Variable units:

pct = log or index  
del = percentage point  
gdp = normalized by gdp  
usgdp = normalized by US gdp  
cent = cents per unit  

## User configurable variables

Some variables can be set by users to design their own experiments.

Note that only exogenous variables and to the initial value of the state variables are configurable when designing simulations.  

Some parameters are also configurable, see next section below.

# Parameters <a id="parameters"></a>

Like variables, parameters are also defined over sets. 

When users adjust parameters, (usually) the entire dynamic of the model will change. 
Thus, (some) parameters can be altered when users design their own experiments.
Those user-defined parameters can be altered in [setparameters.csv](4model_files.md#setparameters).

However, it is currently not supported to load parameters changes from a csv file like you do to variables,
i.e. users cannot specify dynamics to parameters. If you need to see the effects of parameter changes,
you need to run different simulations separately and check their difference in simulation results manually.

# Equations

Like variables, equations are also defined over sets.
