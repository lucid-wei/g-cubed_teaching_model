# Simulations with G-Cubed

To be completed.

## The simulations folder and its contents

The simulations folder contains one folder for each simulation experiment being conducted with the model.

The experiment folder names are user-determined. Each experiment folder contains an experiment design CSV file that configures the experiment, documenting
the layers of adjustments to variables that are to be applied in specific years through the projections.
